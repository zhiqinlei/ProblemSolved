Addition
There are 3 basic rules for adding binary numbers:
0 + 0 = 0
0 + 1 = 1
1 + 1 = 10. If the sum of 2 bits is greater than 1, we need to shift a column on the left. In decimal system, 1 + 1 = 2. Binary notation of 2 is 10 (1 * 2^1 + 0 * 2^0). So we keep 0 in the 1's column and shift (carry over) 1 to the 2's column.
Other rules are same as the decimal system, i.e. we add from right to left and the carry over getâ€™s added to the digits in the next column.
Now lets try adding 11 to 13. Binary for 11 is 1011 and that for 13 is 1101.
1011
+ 1101
1's col = 1 + 1 = 10. We keep 0 in 1's col and carry over 1 to 2's col.
2's col = 1 + 0 + 1 (carry over) = (1 + 0) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 10. Once again we keep 0 in 2's col and carry over 1 to 4's col.
4's col = 0 + 1 + 1 (carry over) = (0 + 1) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 10. Keep 0 in 4's col and carry over 1 in 8's col.
8's col = 1 + 1 + 1 (carry over) = (1 + 1) + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11. Keep 1 in 8's col and carry over 1 in 16's col.
The sum is 11000. 11000 = 1 * 2^4 + 1 * 2^3 + 0 * 2^2 + 0 * 2^1 + 0 * 2^0 = 16 + 8 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 24 = 11 + 13.
